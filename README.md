# WeatherForecaster

## A basic React application which uses the OpenWeather API to obtain a local weather forcaset for the user.

#### The application uses React v16 and styled components.

##### On starting the application , the application attempts to get the Geolocation API to ascertain the latitude / longtitude coordinates of the user. If these coordnates are available then a call to the OpenWeather API is made to provide the local weather forcase for the next 5 days. The application displays the day, temperature and an icon indicating the wetaher conditions to the user. If the location of the user cannot be obtained using the Geolocation API the application renders a form to get the local weather forecast using the ity name and country code. Note this is unfinished.
